<h2>About the project [WIP]</h2>
<p>This project is supposed to replicate <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/">Benedict Evans' blog</a>, everything is written from scratch by me. It's not a full on copy, I kept the design but I added some of my own changes there where I thought it would make sense.</p>
<h4>Why did I choose this?</h4>
<p>I was surfing the internet for different web pages that I could replicate from scratch and Benedict Evans' blog caught my eye. I really liked the design and the way the elements were positioned in the page so I thought it's a good challenge to try and see if I can build it up by myself.</p>
<h5>EDIT:</h5>
<p>It seems that the original blog updated with some new elements. I will continue with how it looked at first and maybe add the news elements at a later time</p>
